### Information:
This is a couple of WIP Goal-Oriented Action Planning Demos based on Jeff Orkin's Work for F.E.A.R.

The POC C++ demo will construct an agent, assign it a goal and then build a (2-step) plan to satisfy that goal.
The other demos are a port to C# and a partial UE4 integration.

This work is quite old now but I would like to revisit it at some point soon as its a pretty cool technique.
